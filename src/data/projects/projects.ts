This is what I build for that assessment and it got me shortlisted for the next round. I created this clone in just 15 hours. I learned about Draft.JS while creating this clone. The major part of this application was to create that editor and it was really challenging. Using Draft.JS I solved this challenge. I also learnt about HTML-based text editing and formatting, looking forward to implementing it in the next versions of this clone.",

But attendance must be taken in such a way that no student can mark the fake attendance and attendance can be taken as fast as possible. So we developed this application. The key point of this application was automatic student and teacher detection using their email id. I have implemented two different dashboards for teachers and students. Teachers can take attendance using their dashboard and students can mark their attendance using the same. The attendance system is QR code based, the QR code has an expiration of 5 seconds so no one can mark fake attendance. The attendance is visible to every teacher according to the timestamp and subjects they teach. Attendance can be printed out or exported as an Excel file. This project was used by my teacher to take attendance in the classroom as the attendance duration was reduced to just 1-5 minutes per class of 100 students.",

      "This is the first Android application that I made using Java while I was learning Android app development using Java. This application is very helpful and is being used by so many small children and students to learn tables from 2 to 100. It has over 100+ downloads on Google Play Stores and I have seen my brothers and sisters using this application and this is why I am proud of it.",

      "This is very close to my heart, this is the one and only game that I have published so far on any of the app stores available. In 2020, I was learning a new game engine called GoDot game engine, at that time I developed this game for PC and Android mobiles. My father was very happy because I developed something that he asked me to develop earlier for his office work, he asked me what I want, and I asked him to purchase a Google Play Store subscription and he bought it for me. After that I published this game on the Google Play store, this was the first game that I have published online. I learnt how to develop games, how to publish games on Google Play Store and how to push updates on Google Play Store.",
